Act as an expert Senior Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer.

Build a modern, responsive, and high-performance landing page for the "ASIET ACM Student Chapter" (Association for Computing Machinery).

### Tech Stack:
- Framework: React (Vite)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion (Crucial for the "modern and clean" feel)
- Icons: Lucide React
- Font: Inter or Space Grotesk (Google Fonts)

### Design System:
- Primary Color: ACM Blue (#0085CA)
- Theme: Clean, minimalist, but tech-focused. Use subtle gradients and glassmorphism (frosted glass) effects on cards to make it feel modern.
- Background: A very clean off-white or light grey for the light theme, with a toggle for a "Midnight Blue" dark mode.

### Required Sections (Single Page Scroll):

1. **Navbar:** Sticky, glass-effect. Links: Home, About, Aswamedha '26, Team, Contact. Includes a "Join ACM" CTA button.

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Headline: "Innovating at ASIET"
   - Subhead: "The Official Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery."
   - Visual: A high-quality abstract tech illustration or 3D element on the right.
   - Animation: Staggered fade-in for text; the image should float slightly.

3. **Featured Event (Aswamedha Focus):**
   - A dedicated, high-priority section highlighting our upcoming Tech Fest participation.
   - Title: "Catch us at Aswamedha"
   - Content: Display 3 event cards (Blind Coding, Prompt Wars, Tech Scavenger Hunt).
   - Interaction: Cards should scale up slightly and glow on hover.

4. **About Us:**
   - Short mission statement about revitalizing the chapter.
   - A grid layout showing key benefits (Networking, Workshops, Distinguished Speakers).

5. **The Team:**
   - A clean carousel or grid for Chapter Officers.
   - Cards should have a placeholder for a photo, Name, Role, and a LinkedIn icon.

6. **Footer:**
   - ASIET ACM branding.
   - Social links.
   - Copyright 2026.

### Specific Animation Requirements:
- Use `framer-motion` for scroll reveal effects (elements fade in and move up as the user scrolls down).
- The buttons should have a "magnetic" feel or a nice sheen effect on hover.
- Ensure the mobile menu has a smooth slide-in animation.

Please structure the project with separate components for Header, Hero, EventCard, and Footer to keep the code clean. Start by generating the complete project structure and the Hero section.
